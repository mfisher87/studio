title: "Better way of storing unused drums"
---

Right now, my unused drums are stored on their sides on shelves behind my drum kit. They
ring out sympathetically and it really bothers me! I need a better long-term way of
storing this equipment.


## Outside of studio

Where? I need to find a way of storing them.


## Muffled

Is there a well-known (but not to me) way of storing drums in a way that they won't ring
like this?
