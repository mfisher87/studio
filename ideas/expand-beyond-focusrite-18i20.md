title: "Expand beyond Focusrite 18i20"

Getting close to maxing out the 18i20 between:

* (5) drum mics
* (2) drum pad analog
* (2) keyboard analog
* (3) vocal microphones
* (2) instruments

I'd like to have more flexibility to add more drum and vocal mics. I'd like to find some
used SM57s and 58s for cheap and refurbish them, but right now I don't have the
available input channels to actually _use_ them.


## Expanding while continuing to use my existing equipment

I'm really interested in MOTU's AVB ecosystem. There are components in that ecosystem
with ADAT connectivity, so I can use my current equipment and grow over AVB going
forward.
